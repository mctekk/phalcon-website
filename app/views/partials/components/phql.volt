            PHQL is a high-level, object-oriented SQL dialect that allows to write queries using a standardized SQL-like language. PHQL is implemented as a parser (written in C) that translates syntax in that of the target RDBMS.
            To achieve the highest performance possible, Phalcon provides a parser that uses the same technology as SQLite. This technology provides a small in-memory parser with a very low memory footprint that is also thread-safe.
